Recent changes include:
  More reliable operation
    - The buoyancy engine now only stalls at the dive end of it's stroke. 
        This eliminates the prolonged, stressful stall at the rise end of the stroke. 
    - The rise stroke now runs on a timer, stall detection is still running in the background. 
        If stall is detected before the timer expires the motor will stop. 
  Improved depth adjustment
    - The rise stroke is terminated when a timer expires. 
        This timer can be adjusted by turning the trim pot on the SeaGlide circuit board.
    - This pot previously controlled the coast time. 
        Controlling the length of the stroke allows for operation in shallower water. 
    - The coast time can be adjusted by changing the "pauseTime" variable 
        in the "Constants" section of the code (at the top).
  Removed infrared receiver code
    - Removed the experimental IR receiver code from the program. 
    - This allows users to program their Arduino boards with SeaGlide code, 
        without having to import any IR receiver libraries. 
    - Experimental IR receiver code will be available for the adventurous. 
    - Eventually this will be refined to accept several different commands from an IR TV remote. 
  Cleaned things up
    - Moved the order of methods around, cleaned up some unused code, improved some logic. 
  Added to and improved comments 
    - Added comments, improved readability and consistency between comments. 
    - More comments = more better. Still more to come
